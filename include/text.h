// Mr G R Josyer Director of the International Academy of Sanskrit Research in Mysore in the course of an interview recently showed
// some very ancient manuscripts which the Academy had collected He claimed that the manuscripts were several thousands of years
// old compiled by ancient rishis Bharadwaja Narada and others dealing not with the mysticism of ancient Hindu philosophy of Atman
// or Brahman but with more mundane things vital for the existence of man and progress of nations both in times of peace and war
// Mr Josyers manuscripts dealt in elaborate detail about food processing from various indigenous materials like grass vegetables
// and leaves for human consumption particularly during times of famine
// One manuscript dealt with Aeronautics construction of various types of aircraft for civil aviation and for warfare He showed me plans
// prepared according to directions contained in the manuscript on Aeronautics of three types of aircraft or Vimanas namely Rukma
// Sundara and Shakuna Vimanas Five hundred slokas or stanzas dealing with these go into such intricate details about choice and
// preparation of metals that would be suitable for various parts of vimanas of different types constructional details dimensions designs
// and weight they could carry and purposes they could be used for
// Mr Josyer showed some types of designs and drawing of a helicopter-type cargo-loading plane specially meant for carrying
// combustibles and ammunition passenger aircraft carrying 400 to 500 persons double and treble-decked aircraft Each of these
// types had been fully described
// In the section giving about preparation and choice of metals and other materials that should go into such construction of aircraft
// details were specified that the aircraft (these metals are of 16 different alloys) must be unbreakable which cannot be cut through
// which would not catch fire and cannot
// p ii
// be destroyed by accidents Details as to how to make these vimanas in flight invisible through smoke screens are given in
// Vimanasastra of Maharshi Bharadwaja
// Further description and method of manufacturing aircraft which will enable pilots not only to spot enemy aircraft but also to hear what
// enemy pilots in their planes were speaking on principles akin to radar have all been given in elaborate detail with suitable
// explanatory notes There are eight chapters in this book which deal with construction of aircraft which fly in air go under water or float
// on water
// TRAINING OF PILOTS
// A few slokas deal with qualifications and training of pilots to man these aircraft These ancient types of aircraft are provided with
// necessary cameras to take pictures of approaching enemy planes Yet another set of slokas deals with the kind of food and clothing to
// be provided for pilots to keep them efficient and fit in air flying conditions
// Mr Josyer said he was attempting to publish these manuscripts suitably translated in English
// Another manuscript dealt with ancient Indian architecture fully illustrated to facilitate construction This treatise is ascribed to
// Maharshi Narada and gives elaborate details about choice of constructional material for various types of buildings even 15 storeys
// high Sectional drawing has also been provided A few chapters deal with construction of villages cities and towns fortresses
// palaces and temples This manuscript is full of plans and engineering constructional details to guide engineers
// Yet another manuscript from which Mr G R Josyer read out passages referred to preparation of imitation diamonds and pearls He
// also showed me another remarkable manuscript which deals in detail about food processing for invalids for youth and for old and
// debilitated persons
// A mild avalanche of letters blew towards us during the following days from all over India One of the first was from James Burke of Life
// International from Delhi asking if he could come and see the Mss We replied Please wire 1000 dollars and then come He was
// taken aback and wrote that he thought people here felt honoured by being mentioned in Life International
// p iii
// but that we seemed to be different We did not reply Now James Burke is dead and great Life International also is no more! Such is
// human evanescence!
// Miss Jean Lyon journalist of Toronto and New York wrote from Delhi that she would visit us She came and saw the Mss and
// recorded her interview with us in her book Just Half a world Away in a chapter headed Science by Sutras concluding with the
// charge that we were guilty of a rabid nationalism seeking to wipe out everything since the Vedas!
// That is no way for a journalist to judge persons We only hold that for Indians or others to wipe out the Vedas is absurd! We are
// neither rabid nor national God has created the Earth like a round ball all its contents forming one compact unit not a hundred and
// odd broken units as in the League of Nations Only in maps is the earth shown broken into 2 hemispheres If you actually break the
// Earth into 2 hemi-spheres you will be having Doomsday!
// Ours is not nationalism rabid or tame but one world humanism or world-citizenship That should not shock Miss Jean Lyon
// Others who wrote to enquire with excited wonder were Governor R R Diwakar of Behar Maharaja of Kashi Dr Trivedi of
// Searchlight Patna Professor Dwivedi of Gorakhpur Professor Chauhan of Seoni Professor Theeanee of Madras Swamy
// Chaitanya of Mussoorie H R Sharma of Phagwara Harit Krishna Deb of Calcutta R B Lal of Allahabad P S Bharathi of
// Ootacamand Miss McIntyre of Bangalore M V Sharma Industrialist Madras D V Potdar of Poona Raja A K N Singh of
// Ramnagar U P Rao Bahadur MA Rangaswamy Patna N Anandalwar Bangalore
// S M Sharma editor wrote in Searchlight Patna To an eminent Sanskrit scholar Shri G R Josyer Director of the International
// Academy of Sanskrit Research Mysore we owe the discovery of the manuscript on Vimanas by Maharshi Bharadwaja Shri Josyer is
// already more than 70 Many Will share my hope and prayer that the Nehru Goverment would lose no time in acquiring the manuscript
// which according to my information is most unique Editor Sharma too is no more!
// The Mss came to us by Divine grace! When on 28-6-1951 we got H H the Maharaja of Mysore to inaugurate the International";
